# review-scores-for-fallguys-game
The best way to improve your data science skills is to practise more,so for that kaggle is providing us with huge number of data sets and compititions.
So in this project i have worked on NLP(natural language processing)
There is a famous game called **fall guys** so kaggle as provided us with this data.

## project description
here,in this project we have to classify the scores for the given reviews text about the game.
so,we have to make use of nlp techniques such as word 2 vec,countvectorizer,tfidfvectorizer...etc
I have used **TfidfVectorizer** to convert my text format to numeric,but before doing this step don't forget to clean your data.
The algorithm i used in this project in **DecisionTree** ,it has given me a very good accuracy.
The other metrics that i have used to know that how good my model is performing is f1_score,precision and recall.
And tha most import thing we have to consider while solving classification problem is **confusion matrix**

NOTE:to know more about confusion matrix visit my blog

## motivation

There is no particular motivation ,just to improve my data science and machine learning skills

## dataset source
**kaggle**
